# CMPUT500-project

## Code
There are six different python notebooks in the repository. Each file has a different model implemented for different problem. The files ending with bugs contain code for Bug Repair and files ending with codeclass contain code for code classification. Each model used is mentiuoned in the name of the file. I used kaggle to train these models. All requirements are already satisfied if you are using kaggle. If you want to run these notebooks locally. Then first download and install anaconda from this website: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual. All instruction for installation are available on the website. After this run these commands to install required libraries:

conda install tensorflow-gpu
conda install jupyter
pip install tqdm
pip install scikit-learn

After installing these librarires run jupyter notebook and open the provided notebook files to train and evaluate the models.

## Datasets

Add these datasets in notebooks if you are using kaggle, if you are running code locally then download these datasets and change the path of the datasets location in the notebooks.
